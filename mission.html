					Opened  in 2009, the Bristol Lisboa Gallery was created by Nuno Tempero [Lisboa] and Fernado Messias [Bristol] with the 
mission to create an authentic Bristol UK art gallery in Lisbon, exclusively showcasing British artists or artists affiliated with Bristol UK,
a platform specializing in contemporary art, with painting, sculpture, moving image, photography, and sound art. <br><br>

The project incorporated three different spaces,  an physical art gallery for exhibitions in Campo de Ourique, Lisbon, an  studio/warehouse in Bristol that supported the
logistics and artistic creation for the gallery, and a online virtual space for presentation, information and worldwide sales.<br><br>

Since 2009 to 2012 was shown several art exhibitions, and installations, providing Lisbon with authentic Bristol UK art.<br><br>

In 2013 the Bristol Lisboa Gallery reshaped into a non-profit platform for cultural and artistic search platform that selects and highlights contemporary artists, galleries and art events, as a pure manifestation of art works that we like,
evolving to a private art studio used as a creative space for artists until 2021 when the project finally closed.<br><br>

With homage to early German Expressionist filmmaking, this animation combines drawn animation/pen and ink with the depictive quality of computer graphics. My accompanying illustration and printed works develop related avenues of social critique, intended to explore something of the grim humor of contemporary existence. <br> <br> <br><br>

					Show 005 | ROBERT MANNERS | <br>Solo Show | <br>25.11.10 - 19.02.11<br>Curator. Fernando Messias |<br>

					<br>Robert Manners Bio Seascape Refits (SSR) is the title of an ongoing series of painted, printed and 3D constructions made up from wood, metal, canvas, plastic and pigment. This is not a new thing. The practice of collecting bits of boats and other coastal flotsam has been compulsive for the past 20 years.<br><br>The term ‘Seascape&rsquo; refers to the tradition of British sea scape painters as far back as Turner to Nicholson and Scott. I am interested in where this tradition ‘goes&rsquo; in a contemporary painting context.<br><br>The ‘Refit&rsquo;, in a literal interpretation, is a term used in the repairing and overhaul of boats and ships. Ports and dockyards being a familiar experience to me as I grew up. In this context however, the ‘refit&rsquo; refers to the modular system of differently constructed panels made from different materials that I make and that are interchangeable. These separate responses reflect different aspects of the seascape/landscape. The tradition of this type of painting is refitted when these elements are bought together into a new and often unplanned arrangement. The paintings are made by a continual process of construction, layering and erosion, change and interchange. In this way, the actual process by which the work is developed closely reflects the change and re-working of the subject itself.<br><br>Sea scape Refits as a series is ongoing and being developed through both the painted and printed medium. <br> <br> <br><br>

					Show 007 | VERTELLI | <br>Solo Show |<br>02.07.11 - 05.11.11<br>

				<p>
					<br>If you are asked to recall a significant place or a memory, that first flash image or snapshot encompasses vivid color, fragmented image and a surreal vision of light, minute detail and larger scale form. In my work I capture this stirred memory, reflecting my instantaneous emotive response. I live and work in Bristol. I have had 16 solo painting exhibitions, one of which had the support of Daddy G from Massive Attack and my work forms part of private collections such as that of the actor Jim Sturgess. My work 'Ono' was chosen to be part of the '100 curators, 100 days' project for Saatchi online. <br> <br> <br><br>

Art with a feminine touch is not what comes in mind, but a refreshing attitude towards everything." Rafael Vieira, editor of Le Cool Magazine and Architect.<br>
